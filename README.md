\noindent NER, acronym for Named Entity Recognition, is placed within a field of study called information extraction (or information extraction).
Also known as Entity Identification and Entity Extraction, it deals with identifying and correctly classifying the Named Entities present in a text into predefined categories such as people, places, objects, numbers, temporal expressions and so on.
By combining the information extracted, a computer can define the topic of a text and understand it properly. In order to do this, given the use made of it in the fields of customer care, search efficiency, and news classification, there is a constant need to refine the entity extraction algorithms.
This paper will investigate the aspects of textual data analysis and the implementation of innovative algorithms based on transformers to perform a comparative evaluation.
