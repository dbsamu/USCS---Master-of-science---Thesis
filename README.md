NER, acronym for Named Entity Recognition, is placed within a field of study
called information extraction (or information extraction). Also known as Entity
Identification and Entity Extraction, it deals with identifying and correctly clas-
sifying the Named Entities present in a text into predefined categories such as
people, places, objects, numbers, temporal expressions and so on. By combining
the information extracted, a computer can define the topic of a text and under-
stand it properly. In order to do this, given the use made of it in the fields of
customer care, search efficiency, and news classification, there is a constant need
to refine the entity extraction algorithms. This paper will investigate the aspects
of textual data analysis and the implementation of innovative algorithms based
on transformers to perform a comparative evaluation.
